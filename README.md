# Mega Memory Game

A simple memory game created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a project for [The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com)

## Live Demo

Try the game here: [https://dinitrogen.github.io/memory-card-game/] (https://dinitrogen.github.io/memory-card-game/)

### Instructions

The game will load 9 images. Clicking on an image will cause the images to shuffle. Continue clicking on images without picking the same one twice, and try for a high score!

Normal mode shuffles the same 9 images (max score 9). Hard mode randomly "deals" a new set of images from a library of 32 images after each click, for a maximum possible high score of 32.
